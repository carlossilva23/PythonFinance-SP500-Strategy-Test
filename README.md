# PythonFinance-SP500-Strategy-Test
In order to teach myself how I can combine my coding skills and finance topics I have learned and are still learning, I'll be pulling data from the S&amp;P 500 and creating a simple strategy in order to assess my quant finance skills, and algorithmic trading knowledge. I want to learn how to apply my coding skills into different financial techniques in order to further my understanding on how computer science and finance integrate with each other. 

Goals: 
- Pull data efficiently
- Create an effective simple strategy
- Calculate strategy's efficiency
- Visualize data

Languages/Libraries
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- yfinance
